# RPG Maker MV Concept Game
A concept RPG Maker game that utilizes several scripts, plugins and other functions to go beyond a typical RPG experience and create a semi-horror atmosphere.


Note: The game file is not hosted on Github due to the file size. You can find the download link here (select the zip file "Returning Hero"):
https://mega.nz/folder/7xkE3CRR#xOBsEKub_6ipl1U731u7kQ

To run the game, please extract the contents into your destination folder of choice and run the Game.exe executable within.
You may need to run the game multiple times for the full experience. (Note: the game "crashing" is on purpose. Relaunch the game and see what changes each time).

If you are not able to download the game due to issues with the Mega hosting service, I have created a showcase video that both shows a demonstration of the game and explains how certain portions were designed:
